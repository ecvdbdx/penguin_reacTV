App build with React (CRA) - Jessica Ferreira &amp; Brandon Leininger  
This project was developed with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).  
This project is under the MIT licence.

## What it is ?
This app, developed in the JavaScript course of ECV Digital's School of Bordeaux, is an App / website to check and review
movies - using the [movieDB](https://www.themoviedb.org/) API.  
In few words, you can check new movies, read some reviews and notation about it, and you can also see some teasers and posters !

<!-- Durant le développement, il sera bon de mentionner (une fois la fonctionnalité créée) la possibilité de créer / consulter des listes (favoris / à regarder plus tard). -->
<!-- Durant le développement, il sera bon de mentionner (une fois la fonctionnalité créée) la possibilité de consulter le compte movieDB de l'utilisateur - si celui-ci en possède un (et a saisit ses infos pour que l'App puisse y accéder). -->
 
## How to use
### Requirements
Before starting to use this App, you must have at least [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your computer.  

In the project directory, you can run:
### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
